								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>I worked on this brace as part of my capstone project (fourth year design project) during my final year of undergrad at the University of Waterloo. I started working on this project before my final year began in August of 2020 with a group of 3 other students. Over the course of 10 months, my team and I researched the issue of Osteoarthritis in the knee and worked on developing a smart solution to help reduce the pain experienced by patients. This is one of the most complex projects that I have ever worked on not simply due to its scale and ambition but also due to the fact that the entirety of the project was done during the pandemic with very limited access to resources.<p>
								<p>My team consisted of a talented group of individuals whos skill sets complemented each other well. Each member was lead various development aspects of the project such as the research, mechanical design, electrical design and software design. My focus for the project was on the mechanical design and manufacturing of the brace along with project/team management. This project required a great deal of coordination and organization in order to be successful and I will explain the part I played in making sure that the team worked as efficiently as possible. This project is one that I am very proud of and I appreciate you taking the time to learn more about it!</p>

								<h3>My Roles & Tasks</h3>
								<p>My two main roles for this project were that of <b>Project Manager</b> and <b>Mechanical Lead</b>.</p>
								<p>As a <b>Project Manager</b> I had the responsibility of maintaining a consistent meeting schedule to ensure that all members of the team were kept up to speed about the project at all times. This was especially crucial as all members of the team were working remotely for a large portion of the project duration due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. In order to allow for the team to easily and efficiently recieve and provide updates, I set up a <u>Kanban Board</u> on Trello for the project and scheduled weekly scrum meetings to allow each team member to list their work during the current week and their upcoming tasks for the following week. I used this style of approach after learning about it through a few of my previous co-op terms and it ended up working really well for this project.</p>

								<p>As the <b>Mechanical Lead</b> for the project I was responsible for creating the mechanical design of the brace in <u>SolidWorks</u> and verifying any and all designs with other team members during design reviews. Before starting the desing however, I worked with my team to discuss possible solutions to the problem that we were trying to solve. This meant researching existing solutions such as passive and active braces and using that information to determine multiple feasible design solutions to the problem. After coming up with design concepts for the type of brace that we wanted to make, a decision matrix was used to determine the best design for our problem. Following that, an iterative design approach was used to reach the final design that you can see in the image below.</p>

								<p>One of the most important aspects of the mechanical design of the brace was the close attention that I had to pay towards the manufacturability of the brace with the resources accessible. <u>Design for manufacturability (DFM)</u> was therefore crucial for this project. As a result I decided to design the brace using thin aluminum and 3D printed components. Using these materials allowed for quick and easy prototyping of various mechanical subsystems. 30 gauge aluminum was chosen for the frame as it was easy to bend without equipment such as a mechanical press at our desposal. Similarly, parts of the design such as anchors and hinge components that required more intricate design were chosen to be 3D printed in order to rapidly test and iterate on their design. Hardware components such as bearings, cables, slides, rails and fasteners were all purchased off the shelf to keep the manufacturing process are straightforward as possible. Finally, the two sides of the brace were kept as mechanically symettrical as possible with only a few components requiring minor modifications in the form of mirroring features. This allowed for the manufacturing and assembly process for the second side of the brace to be extremely simple and straightforward.
								</p>

								<h3>How It Works</h3>
								<p>The brace consists of two sets of cable and spring compression mechanisms on each side. As a user bends their knee, energy is stored in each of the 4 springs of the brace. This energy is then returned to the user when they are unbending their knee in the form of torque. This brace is able to provide a support torque of 2Nm to a user passively which corresponds to a 11% BW relief for our sample user weighing 180lbs. According to our research, as little as 10%BW relief can significantly reduce pain for users. This however is just the start of what our brace can do.<p>
								<p>The "smart" aspect of the brace is it's ability to provide an even larger amount of torque to the user for more strenuous activities. The IMU sensors located on the outter side of the brace collect motion data and the Raspberry Pi on the system analysis the data to classify the user's motion between the activites of walking and climbing stairs. The motor located on each side of the brace provides precompression to the springs, increasing the total torque provided to the user. The entire system is powered by the battery located on the thigh strap of the brace and provides 14 hours of battery life to the brace. One of the most interesting aspects of the mechanical design was creating a system of parts that interfaced with the linear actuating motor to compress both spring sets on one side of the brace simultaneous. Combining that with the cable system connecting the spring compressors to anchor points on the opposite end of the brace was one of the most challenging design problems I have ever had to solve.
								</p>

								<h3>Final Remarks</h3>
								<p>The design and manufacturing of the brace were not the only aspects of the project that were impacted by the pandemic. In order to ensure that a project is successful, validation and testing is required. In our case that validation and testing was heavily dependant on our ability to use university resources such as research labs that have systems in place for testing leg related projects that professors and researchers are working on. We were however unable to access those resources due to the closure of all in-person activities on campus. As a result we had to develop our own test plan and testing aparatus to validate the brace. Similar to the design of the brace, an approach with modularity in mind was taken when developing the testing plan for this brace. Myself and one of my teammates were able to come together to develop a rudamentary testing method that allowed us to evaluate the performance of the passive mechanical system of the brace. Separate testing was done to ensure that our battery life constraints were met. Similarly, the active (motor and sensor) system of the brace was also tested independently to ensure that each aspect of the brace was functioning as intended. A final test was conducted to compare the support provided passively and to the support provided after the application of the active (motor) support.
								</p>
								<p>In the end the project was a great success and is one that I am extremely proud to have been a part of. The memory of working together with a great team to accomplish such a challenging task during a global pandemic is definately something I am going to cherish. Thank you very much for taking the time to reading about this project!
